# Python API Challenge

### Description
  This challenge includes two parts, WeatherPy and VacationPy. We start with WeatherPy and randomly choose a collection of latitude and longitude coordinates. From these coordinates, we run through the cities module and grab the city that is closest to the coordinates. Using these cities, we pull the current weather information from the public weather API, api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q. Note that not all cities will produce a result. After pulling the weather information, we then saved the city and weather information to a csv and analyzed the weather data. There are several charts available with observations based on those charts.
   The VacationPy starts with the city csv pulled from WeatherPy. We start off with displaying the humidity of those cities with a google heatmap (pictured below). I then chose cities based off of "perfect" weather conditions. Your idea of perfect weather could change the results. From these cities, I then found the closest hotels and marked them on our existing heatmap. Included is also an info_box with the hotel name, city and country.
